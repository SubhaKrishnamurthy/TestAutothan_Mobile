  Scenario: Validation of PDDTS Fund Transfer scenario by choosing beneficiary from the list
    Given I'm on Autobahn Corporate user login page with "valid_username" and "valid_password"
    When I click on "TRANSACT" menu option
    And Click on "Fund Transfer" option
    Then "Fund Transfer" page should be displayed with "Make a Transfer", "Manage Beneficiaries" & "View All Organization Transfers"
    When I click on "Make a Transfer" and Choose "PDDTS" channel
    And Enter the transfer details with "SourceAccount" & "Beneficiary"
    And Review the transfer details with "Beneficiary" details
    And click Submit
    Then Transaction should be successful
